## Architecture Overview

The app is divided into four main layers:

- **Presentation**: SwiftUI views and ViewModels
- **Domain**: Business logic, entities, and use cases
- **Data**: Networking, DTOs, and repository implementations
- **Core**: Dependency Injection, routing, and utilities

Dependencies always point inward, ensuring loose coupling and testability.

## Folder Structure

Refer to the project structure for a clear separation of concerns.

## Key Concepts

- SwiftUI for UI
- MVVM for presentation logic
- Clean Architecture for business logic isolation
- Protocol-oriented programming
- Dependency Injection

## Benefits

- Highly testable
- Scalable
- Maintainable
- Framework-independent domain layer

## Use Cases

Ideal for:
- Production apps
- Learning Clean Architecture
- Technical interviews
- Teaching SwiftUI architecture
